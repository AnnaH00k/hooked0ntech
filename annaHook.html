    <section>

  <p>Hey there! I'm Anna Hook, a 23-year-old computer science student, programmer, and enthusiastic employee at Clye, a startup that keeps me on my toes and provides invaluable learning experiences. My journey into the world of technology has been a fascinating exploration of self-discovery and growth.</p>

  <p>At the age of 17-21, I found myself working at a swimming pool, where my interest in programming began to take shape. Starting with a small project— a learning app for pool staff— I discovered the joy of coding, accomplishment, and the vast possibilities in the tech world.</p>

  <p>Fast forward to today, I'm in my third semester at IU International University of Applied Sciences, studying computer science 100% online for that extra flexibility. Balancing full-time studies with a challenging 20-hour-per-week role at Clye, I'm determined to make the most of every opportunity.</p>

  <p>But it doesn't stop there. I'm on a mission to create multiple streams of income, believing in the financial security and freedom that come with it. Here are some avenues I'm exploring:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>YouTube:</strong> I'm diving into the world of YouTube, creating content on programming, studyvation videos and more. It's not just about earning money but also about sharing knowledge and connecting with a wider audience.</li>
    <li><strong>Book about App Development:</strong> Currently working on a book that covers the basics of app development, from programming languages to design principles and marketing strategies. I aim to publish it within the next one to three years.</li>
    <li><strong>Creating More Apps:</strong> Building on the success of my first app, I'm excited about the potential in creating more. Always on the lookout for new ideas and opportunities, I can't wait to see where this path leads.</li>
    <li><strong>Developing tech solutions:</strong> I dont have enogh knowledge to create complex solutions, but i have many ideas in the fields of AR, robotics and Webdevelopment.</li>

    <li><strong>Writing:</strong> Whether it is in the form of writing creative science fiction novels or short storys and blog posts. If I find the time I dabble in creating beautiful texts.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>In conclusion, creating multiple streams of income is my key to financial success and personal freedom. It's a journey that demands hard work and dedication, but the possibilities are thrilling.</p>

  <p>So, who am I? I'm more than a computer science student or a startup employee; I'm on a continuous journey of self-discovery and growth. I aim to share my experiences, struggles, and insights, creating a community of learners, thinkers, and doers.</p>

  <p>If you're reading this, I invite you to join me on this exciting journey. Together, we can create something amazing.</p>
